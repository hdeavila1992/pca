# PCA (parametric curve assistant)
This python functions are made with the purpose to helps engineering to easily create NURBS, B-spline, Bezier and other kind of parametric curves and plotting them
In this files you will found:
B-spline and NURBS Basis function
Aplication of Basis function to create 2D B-spine curves, 3D B-spline curves. surface B-spline, 2D NURBS curve, 3D NURBS curve
and surface NURBS curve
Ploting curves and surface B-spline and NURBS
